Yet another ML method comparison, a comparison of 
* Gaussian Process Regression
* XGBoost
* FeedForward Neural Network

We are only comparing algorithms here, the same descriptors (RDKit Morgan2) are used throughout.

Datasets are from [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00542](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00542)
